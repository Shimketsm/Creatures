Creatures was a project created by Saejin Mahlau-Heinert(Github:Michionlion) and Mark Shimkets for our final project for a class. Creatures is a prototype of hearthstone. While we worked on the project Mark designed a lot of the system while Saejin provided a lot of the implementation. I am updating the project with better AI, an actual card deck system, and gradle support.
